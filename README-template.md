## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

This project, simple yet instructive, was a good learning exercise.
I could use then recently discovered Sass, learn to draw a simple shape with CSS, practice the background layout and have a better grasp with absolute/relative positioning.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
body {
  background: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg), #19A1AD;
  background-position: -43% 54%, 133% -35%, 0 0;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
  body {
    background-position: 170% 60%, -75% -60%, 0 0;
    background-size: 600px 600px;
  }
}
```
```css
.half-circle {
  width: 106px;
  height: 53px;
  border-top-left-radius: 54px;
  border-top-right-radius: 54px;
  position: absolute;
  top: -53px;
  left: 122px;
  background-color: #fff;
  box-shadow: 0 -1px 1px #19A1AD;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
  .half-circle {
    left: 112px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I will search to improve my html structure and classes naming to keep my code maintenable. I'm interested in keep learning to draw shapes with CSS.
I'm not quite satisfied with how I positioned the background patterns, as it is not responsive. I focused on mobile (iPhone X) and desktop (14inches) viewports and need another solution to make the background responsive for al screen sizes.
