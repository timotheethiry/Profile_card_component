### What I learned

This project, simple yet instructive, was a good learning exercise.
I could use then recently discovered Sass, learn to draw a simple shape with CSS, practice the background layout and have a better grasp with absolute/relative positioning.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
body {
  background: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg), #19A1AD;
  background-position: -43% 54%, 133% -35%, 0 0;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
  body {
    background-position: 170% 60%, -75% -60%, 0 0;
    background-size: 600px 600px;
  }
}
```
```css
.half-circle {
  width: 106px;
  height: 53px;
  border-top-left-radius: 54px;
  border-top-right-radius: 54px;
  position: absolute;
  top: -53px;
  left: 122px;
  background-color: #fff;
  box-shadow: 0 -1px 1px #19A1AD;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
  .half-circle {
    left: 112px;
  }
}
```
